# Search Safari and Chrome Tabs for Alfred

Taken verbatim from http://www.packal.org/workflow/search-safari-and-chrome-tabs

But updated so it works. As it had stopped working for me in Chrome.

# Installation.

Hit the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/barn/Search_Safari_and_Chrome_Tabs_alfred/archive/master.zip)

Rename that zipfile to "search_safari_and_chrome_tabs.alfredworkflow"

Double click on it.

# License

Absolutely no idea. I just copied it and made it work.
